# Botnet-Detection-Technique-Using-Machine-Learning-Classifiers

A P2P botnet detection system using machine learning classifiers, decision tree mainly.

Today, botnets prove to be one of the most scandalous threats to network security. Botnets usually acquire two structures - the Client-Server structure and the Peer-to-Peer structure. While Client-Server botnets employ a centralized communication architecture, Peer-to-Peer botnets tend to adopt a decentralized architecture for exchanging commands and controlling data, hence making their detection more difficult.

The proposed model has been trained and tested on the publicly available CTU-13 dataset. This dataset contains a large capture of mixed data containing botnet traffic, legitimate traffic, and background traffic from 13 scenarios like click fraud, port scan, fast flux, etc. 

The five machine learning algorithms employed are Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbour, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes. On performing comparative analysis, the Decision Tree algorithm successfully detected Peer-to-Peer botnet traffic by demonstrating an imposing accuracy of 98.2%.
